# Thesis Project: The Role of Divisive Topics in Network Structure
The idea is to trace out politicized topics/hashtags and investigate whether they make an impact on the structure of the above mentioned graph. Examples could be anything which people are emotionally/politically invested in (could be anything like #metoo, #trump2016, #maga, #lockherup, #imwithher, etc). Using tweets containing those, along with the twitter graph, we can answer questions like: Are people who interact with each other using such hashtags interact more or less afterwards? Can we predict whether such hashtags will weaken or strengthen interactions using sentiment analysis tools? Can we profile users based on prior content and predict how they react to such hashtags (for instance classifying people's political orientation and see how their usage of political hashtags depends on whether they interact with people similar or dissimilar to themselves)? This is interesting because it plays into the currently somewhat hyped notion of filter bubbles - it's popular to talk about newsfeed algorithms causing people to mainly see content they sympathize with, but there is evidence that a stronger factor is people's tendency to choose to interact with specific content and actors.
