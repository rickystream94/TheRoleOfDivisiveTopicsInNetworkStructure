    "Sentiment Analysis and Tweets text classification is a common task among NLP-ers although highly subject to misclassification risks due to the ambiguous nature of the text content and the actual sentiment they want to transmit. It's not uncommon, indeed, to see sarcastic Tweets whose actual sentiment is not trivial to be inferred by a classifier that has been trained on pure positive/negative/neutral emotions. \n",
    "\n",
    "With my analysis, I want to achieve the following goals:\n",
    "1. **Compute Sentiment Analysis Score for different sets of hashtags**: Pick sets of Tweets of hashtags that are strongly left/right leaning (e.g. #ImWithHer is left leaning or democrats/liberals, whereas #MAGA is right-leaning or republicans/conservatives) and compute average sentiment score (first by using the built-in classifier provided by TextBlob pre-trained on movies reviews, secondly (*if time allows it*) using a custom classifier trained ad-hoc on actual Tweets) for each of them and show Sentiment Score distribution with boxplots where observations are individual tweets; show basic stats (e.g. percentage of tweets with positive/negative sentiment, show the top positive/negative tweets);\n",
    "2. **Political Text classification**: Build corpus of tweet texts for each category (Right, Left for simplicity) and build classifier to predict political orientation (polarity) by content of tweet, using bag-of-words/TF-IDF approaches. This would not be a perfect political tendency classifier, mainly because the content of each tweet related to a certain hashtag might not entirely reflect an opinion on *that* hashtag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting political tendency of user based both on the content of the tweets and its role and properties in the network structure is a task that requires more complicated steps and an accurate methodology for which I have no time left to be spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "I've chosen to work mainly with the `TextBlob` Python package, which basically exposes a wrapper for the well-known `NLTK` (Natural Language ToolKit) package, largely adopted for Natural Language Processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Pre-Processing\n",
    "Tweets often include noisy data that ideally should be cleaned up prior to any analysis. Luckily, for the sake of the sentiment analysis, `TextBlob` comes handy as it offers most of the required pre-processing tasks out of the box and are already automatically performed when calculating the sentiment score. The pre-processing tasks I would consider include (in order):\n",
    "- Converting the text to lowercase\n",
    "- Translation of non-english tweets *(ignored because of performance degradation)*\n",
    "- URL stripping *(this has already been applied by the script used to download the Tweets)*\n",
    "- Removing non-ASCII characters, symbols, numbers\n",
    "- Removing User mentions\n",
    "- Spell-checking and correction *(ignored because of performance degradation)*\n",
    "- Removing stopwords\n",
    "- Filtering out short words (e.g. $len(w) \\leq 3$)\n",
    "- Emoticon detection (already nicely handled by default by `TextBlob`)\n",
    "- Stemming and lemmatisation, to group together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item\n",
    "- Perform POS (Part-Of-Speech) tagging to select only relevant features/tokens (like nouns, verbs, adjectives)\n",
    "\n",
    "`TextBlob`, luckily, already performs most of the text parsing and pre-processing listed above before computing the sentiment score. However, we still want to perform all of these in order to perform further text analysis. In order to perform sentiment analysis without loosing information provided by punctuation, I define two functions to process the tweets text as defined above. One would be the *baseline cleaner function* (enough prior to carrying out the SA task) and the other one the *advanced cleaning function* (to be used prior to the text classification task)."
