This property would already give a built-in definition of *interaction consistency*; however, the information we may infer from it is quite limited, and the reason is that for each pair of users we only know whether they have interacted (consistently) within a 3 months period, and given the ranges of our timeline this sums up to a total of 13 periods. It's the only way, however, to compare how interaction consistency has changed overtime;\n",
    "- **Tweets**: when limiting the scope to the tweets related to a specific topic (hashtag), I have no information about which other topics all involved users have been tweeting about neither the related temporal information. Therefore, I may only know when has the *first* Twitter interaction occurred between each pair of mutually interacting users and all the subsequent ones. This is something that has already been highlighted a bit with the previous section, however I may further narrow it down and measure interactions consistency overtime if I count the interactions *per month*."

It's worth pointing out that the hashtag subgraphs have been created by picking *all* involved users for all the tweets that have been downloaded, without actually checking which ones are directly connected by a $H$ hashtag conversation. Hence, extracting the subgraph directly from the bigger graph by just passing this list of users, may have generated a bigger graph (including edges between nodes that may have not been captured by the MMR graph data for *this* specific hashtag). For example, if users $A$ and $B$ were involved in a conversation concerning *#bananas* and the MMR graph data has actually not captured this specific interaction but instead the one between the same users about *#apples*, when extracting the *#bananas* subgraphs, users $A$ and $B$ will still be captured. This is a kind of a bug in the thinking process and the direct consequence is that it has emphasized a bit the size of the actual hashtag subgraph.\n",
